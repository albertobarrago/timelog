## Apps

| App | Platform | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Timelog** (iOS) | iPhone / iPad | Full-featured mobile app with Live Activity on lock screen |
| **TimelogMac** (macOS) | macOS 14+ | Native menu bar app with full window management |

Both apps share business logic via **TimelogCore**, a local Swift Package in the same repo.

---

## iOS Features

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Today** | Log time manually or start real-time sessions; live daily total |
| **Clients** | Manage clients (color coded) and their projects; archive when done |
| **Timer** | Stopwatch or Pomodoro with ring progress and lock-screen notification |
| **Settings** | Wethod API, Pomodoro intervals, daily reminders, smart tracking config |

### Smart Tracking
Tap ▶ to start a session when you begin working. Stop it when done — duration is logged automatically. Multiple sessions can run simultaneously. Forgot to stop? You get a notification at your configured end-of-day time.

### Reminders
Set a daily nudge at a chosen time on chosen days so nobody on your team forgets to fill in their timesheet.

### Live Activity (iOS)
Active sessions and the running timer appear on the lock screen and in the Dynamic Island — no need to open the app.

---

## macOS Features

- **Menu bar icon** — always visible; shows live elapsed time while timer is running
- **Today view** — active sessions with live ticker, today's entries, context menus
- **Clients & Projects** — `NavigationSplitView` with macOS `Table`, inline create/edit forms
- **Timer** — full Pomodoro / stopwatch window, Space to start/pause
- **Settings window** — Pomodoro config, smart tracking end-of-day threshold (`⌘,`)

## Requirements

| App | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| iOS | Xcode 16+, iOS 17+, physical device for Live Activity |
| macOS | Xcode 16+, macOS 14+ |

No external dependencies — pure Swift ecosystem (SwiftData, Keychain, ActivityKit, UserNotifications).

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlbertoBarrago/Timelog.git
cd Timelog
```

**iOS:** open `Timelog.xcodeproj`, select the `Timelog` scheme, run on device or simulator.

**macOS:** open `TimelogMac.xcodeproj`, select the `TimelogMac` scheme, run.

> Both projects reference `TimelogCore` as a local package — no extra setup needed.

**Wethod integration**: add your Base URL and API Key in Settings — stored securely in the Keychain.

**Live Activity**: requires iPhone 14 Pro or later for Dynamic Island; any iPhone for lock screen banner.

---

## Architecture

- **TimelogCore** — shared `@Observable` models and business logic, public API, iOS + macOS 14+
- **MVVM** — `TimerViewModel` lives at app level, injected via SwiftUI environment
- **SwiftData** — single `ModelContainer` shared across all scenes (window + menu bar)
- **Keychain** — Wethod API key never stored in UserDefaults
- **ActivityKit** — Live Activities managed by `TimerViewModel` (iOS only, compile-guarded)
- **UserNotifications** — daily reminders, session overdue alerts, Pomodoro phase-end
